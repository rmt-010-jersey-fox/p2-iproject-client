## Intro
Flashero is a simple flashcard app inteded for helping memorizing things. Some of flashcard usual use are but not limited to: languange learning, memorizing-based lesson such as history/economy, etc. Flashero is basically just an app version of that but with a twist you can gain XP to level up your character each time you answered your card right! 

## Account Level System
You can level up your account by studying with flashero! The more cards you cleared and able to answer, the more XP you gained! This gimmick is hopefully able to helps you to keep up with your studies regularly!

## Mastery System
There is also a mastery system where a flashcard will appear less frequently the higher its mastery. Mastery level is increased +1 everytime you can answer it with a 'good' mark. That means a higher mastery level, the better your understanding with that card ( Only if you pick the answer honestly ofc ). 

The higher mastery also means the higher XP gain on clear too! What if I somehow forget that card? picking 'again' when studying resets the card's mastery back to 0, and picking 'hard' will keep the mastery level so that the interval the next due will be the same.
